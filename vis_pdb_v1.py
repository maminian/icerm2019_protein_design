orthologs  - how do reads align show up in data vs known orthologs?
distribution of ortholog expression across 

tweaking with alignment params

cytoscape - cluego
XGSA
inter-species gene ontology comparison.

REMEMBER - genes can belong to multiple pathways. 
what might be found that there is some similarity, but also som edifference
how to reconcile truth something as precise as genes, to less precise 
concept pathway. 

#######

be aware of redundancy 
levels of counts b/w orthologs 
consider something similar in the pathway analysis; 
might say what is the distribution of correct pathways identified. 

relationship between pathways? network-based analysis b/w pathways?

layers of specificity when doing GO 

##transcription

cellular process
biological function
organism 

hierarchical system.
